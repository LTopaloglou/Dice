# Dice
A simulation of a dice game I created.

For my Grade 12 Data Management course (Spring 2021), we had to create a probability-based game and then analyse the outcomes.
The rules are shown below and in the Rules and Materials pdf.
The mathematical analysis is available in the Theoretical Analysis and Experimental Results pdf.
The program used to simulate the game and produce the experimental results can be run throug the DiceMain.java file.

RULES:

  1. The two players compete in an innings system. Each player can either succeed or fault in an inning. If one player succeeds while the other player faults, they win the game. If both players fault or both players succeed, the game continues for another inning until one player eventually wins.

  2. Both players participate in an individual game to determine whether they succeed or fault in an inning. The game works as follows:

  3. The player rolls a 6-sided die and records the number X that they roll.

  4. The player now rolls that same die up to X times, or until they roll that same number X. If the player is able to roll an X, they succeed. If a player is unable to roll an X within their allotted number of rolls, they fault.
